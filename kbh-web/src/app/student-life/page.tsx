            <p >
              Knightsbridge Houseâ€™s Nonthaburi campus in Thailand is located
              in the suburbs of Bangkok, offering a spacious and green
              environment.
              <br />
              <br />
              Facilities include well-equipped classrooms, a science lab, and art studio, sports fields,
              a swimming pool, and more.
              <br />
              <br />
              KBH will be a fully independent international school. While located within the premises
              of Pichayasuksa School, our school will be separated physically, with the management,
              curriculum, teaching staff, and operational standards adhering to international school
              benchmarks.
              <br />
              <br />
              The school is conveniently located 3km away from BTS Station (Pink Line) Chaeng
              Wattana-Pak Kret 28, which is next to Central ChaengWatthana, a major shopping and
              lifestyle hub.
